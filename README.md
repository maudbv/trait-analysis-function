# R functions for analysing trait distributions in ecologcial communities

Three R functions to calculate the range, the four moments and Rao's quadratic entropy for trait distributions within ecological communities, tested and standardized against null models.
The functions are almost but not quite generic, used for previous publications before 2013.
